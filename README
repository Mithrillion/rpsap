This is the experiment code and supplementary material for the Paper "Quasi-periodicity Detection via Repetition Invariance of Path Signatures".

The scripts OPT_{dataset}_{algorithm}_eval.py are used for hyperparameter search with Optuna to find the best hyperparameter options for each algorithm. the {dataset}_{algorithm}_eval.py scripts are used for evaluating performance with optimised hyperparameter settings. Recofit_random_drop_full_comparison.py performs the synthetic warping experiment using random drop as in the paper.

supplementary.pdf is the supplementary material for the paper.

env.yml can be able to set up the right conda environment. Run `conda env create -f env.yml` to create a conda environment from the file. You may also use *mamba* to speed up dependency resolution. The current YAML file is set up assuming CUDA is available, but the experiments should still run without GPU. Remove the CUDA dependencies if needed.
